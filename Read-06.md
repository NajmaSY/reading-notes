## JavaScript
A programming language which allows you to implement complex features for web pages
- makes it dynamic and interactive and is used alongside html and css
- can store values using variables e.g. name
- uses 'strings' to perform operations or functions
- can dynamically modify html and css to update a user interface
- it runs code from top to bottom so it must have some structure

## Basic Output
- can run JavaScript on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari etc.
- can run in a text editor such as VS Code
- can embed the code into html files using <script>

Ways to display text to user
- <alert> can popup in browser. 
- <document.write> changes content of a page
- console.log - is not visible, browser can print out warning and errors of javascript code

## JS input with prompt and confirm
two ways to receive input
- prompt - shows up in popup window with text provided for user to fill in. press ok - value will be returned by the prompt() function
- confirm - allows developer to ask yes/no question
ok - returns true, cancel - returns false
uses an if/else construct e.g. If the user presses OK when we asked "Shall I print Hello World?", then print "Hello World", otherwise print "OK, I won't print it."

1 variables in JavaScript is where you store a value 
2 to declare a variable, use var, let or const so it can be used later on
3 assignment operator assigns a value to a keyword using an equals sign
4 information received from the user is called user output
